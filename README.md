# activity-mapping

This repo contains a list of microservices related activities that can be used in a mapping exercise.  The goal is to determine what type of work (activities) need to be done, how the activities should be distributed and what types of boundaries should be implemented on top of the activities.

## Analysis Phase

1.  Select activities from each of the categories that you deem important and relevant.  
1.  Create your own additional activities if needed.
1.  For each activity, identify which team, group or person typically performs :
    * Information Gathering
    * Choice Generation
    * Making a Choice
    * Approval of the Selected Choice
    * Execution of the choice (the work)
    * Challenging the choice that was made

This analysis should give you an indication of how the work in your organization is distributed.  In particular, make note of which teams are responsible for choice generation, selection and choice authorization.

## Experimentation Phase
